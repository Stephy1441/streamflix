Key Insights
- The largest user groups are aged 21–30 and 31–40, with significant engagement also from users aged 41–50. These age groups collectively form the core audience.
- The user base is nearly evenly split between free users (48.94%) and subscribers (51.06%). This suggests a healthy conversion rate but also a significant portion of users yet to convert.
- The top 10 movies by average rating all score very highly (mostly 5.0), indicating that quality content is recognized and valued by users.
- Users access the platform almost equally via Mobile, Smart TV, Desktop, and Tablet, with only slight variation in numbers. This indicates a need for cross-device optimization.

Recommendations
- Since nearly half the users are still on the free tier, offer time-limited trials, exclusive previews, or early access to popular drama and comedy content to encourage conversion.
- Consider bundling popular genres or top-rated content as part of the subscription to make the upgrade more attractive.
- Tiered Plans: Introduce basic, standard, and premium subscription tiers to cater to different user needs and viewing habits.
- Targeted Content Strategy: Match the right content to the right audience segments.
